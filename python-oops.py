#Python OBject Oriented Programming intro
#object = A bundle of related atttributes (variables) and methods (functions)
#  Ex. phone , cup, book
#  you need a class to create many objects

#inheritance
# Inheritance = Inherit attributes and methods from another class

#abstract classes
# Abstract class: A class that cannot be instantiated on its own; Meant to be subclassed.
#                 They can contain abstract methods, which are declared but have no implementation.
#                 Abstract classes benefits:
#                 1. Prevents instantiation of the class itself
#                 2. Requires children to use inherited abstract methods
#                 3. it has be to declared inside children class (every abstract method should be declared)
#                 4. you cant make object with it but only children
